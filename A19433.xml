            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now therefore my friend, if
<pb facs="tcp:9319:8"/> theſe ſpeeches of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Fathers to our bleſſed Lady be lawfull, certainly there is no prayer of this book as made to Saints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, for if they be not lawful as prayers, they bee lawfull as <hi>Apoſtrophes.</hi> And if thy ſtomack riſe not againſt theſe wordes of the Fathers, no reaſon it ſhould deteſt the like ſpeeches of ours. And if theſe may faynedly be vſed to exite affection, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo may be likewiſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed to inflame our deuotion.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, if thou canſt frame thy conſcience to beleeue, that all theſe prayers and the like, are nothing elſe but fayned ſpeches; this will be one way, according to the doctrine of thine owne maſters, not onely to ſerue thy ſelfe, but alſo to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie others, that ſhall obiecte the reading of this Booke, or
<pb facs="tcp:9319:9"/> the practiſe thereof vnto thee. But if according to truth and reaſon, thou be ſo perſwaded, that neither wee, nor the holy Fathers, either doe, or may vſe ſuch <hi>figmatiue</hi> or fayned pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; it will import thee, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the other way, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with vs, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpoken vnto the Saints; not as vnto walles and woods, but as vnto thoſe, that verily heare vs, and are able to help vs.</p>
            <p>And therefore, becauſe I do not thinke thou wilt eaſily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the holy Fathers of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, wherein no ignorance can excuſe their damnation: but rather will deſire ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction in this point according to the Scripture, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy Maſters would ſeeme to make the onely ground of their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That I may the better

            <p>But before I begin, I deſire to informe thee of 4. ſhort perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers; wherof the two firſt are ſuch, as may ſuffice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alone to reſolue this queſtion.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Proteſtants, haue agreed with vs in this point. For the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> in his owne words was this that followeth.<note place="margin">Luther in purgatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne quoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Of interceſſion of Saints, I thinke and iudge with the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, that the Saints are to bee honoured by vs, and alſo to be
<pb facs="tcp:9319:10"/> inuocated.</hi> With whom doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note n="a" place="margin">acts &amp; mon: pag 462.</note> 
               <hi>Bilnay,</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">acts and mon pag 1312.</note> 
               <hi>Latimer,</hi> canonized Martyrs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Calender. Wherefore this being the beleefe, not only of their firſt Apoſtle; but alſo of their latter Martyrs; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, how it may ſtand with the reputation of a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Proteſtant, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn vs, or to miſlike vs for it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond perticuler which I would haue thee well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, is this; That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ground whereon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants doe eſpecially build their deniall, or rather their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of this Doctrine, is moſt vaine and friuolous; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, Inuocation of Saints to be altogether vnlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no where expreſly commaunded or approued in holy Scripture. For, I wold but
<pb facs="tcp:9319:10"/> aske a Proteſtant, where he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Hunting, or Hawking to be expreſly commanded, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Word of God? which, vnleſſe he loue Hawkes and Dogs, better then Saints or Angels, were enough to make him ſee, the impertinencie of this poſition. In a word, I will demaund, where he findeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Aſſertion it ſelf, which they make the ground of their beleife; to bee expreſly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: or (to giue inſtance in ſome other particulers) where he can ſhew me, The eating of Blood and ſtrangled meat: the celebration of Chriſtmas, and of the Feaſtes of the Apoſtles: the vſe of Surpliſſe, Cappe, and Typpet in the ſeruice of Chriſt: Or in fine, The abrogation of the Iewes Saboth, which is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, to be expreſly either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
<pb facs="tcp:9319:11"/> or approoued in holy writ? Which, not being able to performe, he not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth himſelfe in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practiſe of all theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers, if hee ſtand to his owne ground: but alſo maketh the Ground it ſelfe, to ouerthrow it ſelfe, as being no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taught in holy Scripture. Wherfore, though no laudable example of prayer to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, could be found in the written Word: yet this is no ſufficient cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it. From whence alſo it foloweth; That vnleſſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Proteſtants can ſhew (which they will neuer be able to doe) that prayer to Saints is euidently forbidden, either by the word of God, or light of nature, or lawe of the Church; They can neuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended or excuſed, from great
<pb facs="tcp:9319:11"/> impietie and damnable ſciſme, in deuiding them ſelues, not only from the Catholicke bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: but alſo from the Saints themſelues by this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly therefore, to come nerer the queſtion in hand, that we diſpute not of wordes, but of the matter it ſelfe, now in controuerſie betwene thee and me; Thou muſt vnderſtand, that the worde Prayer, is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for a requeſt made vnto him, whom we honour as the firſt omnipotent cauſe, and infinite Author of all thinges. Secondly, for a petition made vnto thoſe, whom we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be indued with that excellencie, which is only fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the friends of God that are in heauen: and laſtly, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made vnto any other, with that reſpect, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:9319:12"/> to bee due vnto thoſe, that haue the meanes to helpe vs. In the firſt &amp; ſecond ſenſe, this word is vſed, when we are ſaid to pray, or to make our prayer vnto another: in the laſt ſenſe, when wee pray our friends or our betters to doe this, or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for vs; For although we pray them; yet wee are not properly ſaid to pray, or to make our prayer vnto them. By Prayer to Saincts therefore, we vnderſtand a requeſt made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, not with that worſhip which is due vnto God, as the Author of all things: but with that honour and reuerence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is due to the Saints of God aboue all other Creatures. And in this ſenſe the Proteſtants the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues will graunt, That if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make any requeſt vnto them, it ought to be done with
<pb facs="tcp:9319:12"/> that reuerence which is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; &amp; by conſequence, that in this ſenſe, it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pray them (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at all) but alſo to pray vnto them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to the end that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be taken againſt the proofes that follow, as not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently deliuered according to my promiſe out of Scripture, thou muſt conſider that two ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of wayes a thing may be proued out of Scripture. Firſt, by the expreſſe wordes thereof in which manner we proue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. As for example, <hi>That man is iuſtified by workes and not</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:9319:13"/> the Proteſtants cannot direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, any one point of their Religion againſt vs. Therfore no reaſon that in all points, they ſhould exact this kinde of proofe at our hands. Secondly a thing may bee prooued by Scripture, as following by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence out of ſcripture, which kind of proofe and no other the Proteſtants (though failing therein no leſſe then in the former) pretend to be the very ground of their Faith, in thoſe points wherein they differ from vs; And after this manner, I intend to make it euident that prayer to Saints may bee lawfully vſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9319:18"/> excite vs ſo much the more thereby to this kinde of pyous worſhip &amp; inuocation of them. For if ſinfull men on earth, are truely vnderſtood, to bee here comprehended vnder the name of Saints: much leſſe may the Bleſſed ſoules of Heauen, be here excluded from that tytle. And who can imagine that the Soules of the iuſt, are ſeperated by death, from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church wherein they liued? For as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, why doe they run ſo faſt to the Sacrament of Baptiſme in extreame danger of death, that were neuer in the Church before?

Wherefore, I do
<pb facs="tcp:9319:18"/> not ſee, how we can beleeue, that there is one Communion of the Saints in heauen, and the Saints on earth according to our Creed: except we beleeue a Communion, or which is all one, a <hi>Communication</hi> of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall offices betweene them; wee praying to them, and they praying for vs: the greater hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the leſſe, and the leſſe in all their neceſſities, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto the greater.</p>

               <p>Is alſo in explication and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the former. And ſuppoſing that if it be lawfull to pray the Saints of Heauen, it is no leſſe lawfull to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as I haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the third conſideration; It may be framed in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner.
<pb facs="tcp:9319:19"/> It is lawfull to recommend our wants by way of prayer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie, vnto all the friends of God, that are deſirous to heare vs and are able to helpe vs in perticuler. But ſuch are all the Saints of Heauen; Therefore it is lawfull in ſuch manner to commend our ſelues, and our wants vnto them.</p>
               <p>The Maior is ſo euident, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the light of Nature, that there needeth no Scripture to confirme it. For as now at this day, ſo no doubt before the Scripture was written, it was lawfull for the childe to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:9319:19"/> waight, which the Proteſtants alleadge for their not praying to Saints, is eſpecially this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thinke the Saints of heauen doe not heare them; Wherefore if they heare and can and will helpe vs, there is no further doubt, but that wee may pray and beſeech them to relieue vs.</p>
               <p>The Minor therefore, that the Saints in Heauen are moſt deſirous, and likewiſe moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to heare and helpe vs, is prooued firſt, a <hi>Poſteriore,</hi> or from the effect: and ſecondly a <hi>Priore,</hi> or from the cauſe: a <hi>Poſteriore,</hi> thus; They doe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually preſent or reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend our prayers vnto God; <hi>The foure</hi>

                  <hi>Beaſts, and the 24. Elders, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing golden vialls full of Odours, which are the Prayers of Saints.</hi> Therefore they not onely know
<pb facs="tcp:9319:20"/> our prayers in perticuler (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou wilt imagine, that they Offer them ſealed vp in a Bag, as ignorant of that which is contained in them) but alſo are a meane to God for vs, and helpe vs to obtaine them.</p>
               <p>The ſame is alſo prooued a <hi>Priore</hi> three manner of waies.</p>
               <p>And firſt, by the perfit loue and charitie, which is between the Saints in heauen, and their brethren here on earth. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Charitas nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam excidit,</hi> Charitie (which is the loue of God and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) neuer falleth away, but remaineth with his Saints for euer. And the reaſon thereof is manifeſt. For, louing God ſo perfitly as they doe, they muſt needes loue all thoſe, whom they know to bee ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of him, as that he gaue
<pb facs="tcp:9319:20"/> his onely Son to redeem them. This therefore being ſuppoſed out of Scripture, and the Minor conſiſting of two parts; The firſt, that the Saints of heauen, deſire to heare and helpe vs, And the ſecond, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe both the one &amp; the other. The firſt part I proue by the latter, in this manner: The Saints of God deſire it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot want y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means to performe it.</p>
               <p>That they deſire it, is proued firſt out of the Nature of all true loue in generall. For the which you muſt vnderſtand, That <hi>Loue</hi> being the firſt act of the <hi>Will:</hi> and the <hi>formall</hi> obiect of both the act, and power of the will, beeing that which is good; to loue another, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to <hi>will</hi> him that which is good, eſpecially for
<pb facs="tcp:9319:21"/> this reaſon, becauſe it is good vnto him. So that, the finall and formal cauſe of true loue, being the good of another; To loue one truly, is to wiſh him all the good that may be; and to loue very much, is to <hi>will,</hi> or to wiſh the ſame very much vnto him.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is the Nature of the will, and by conſequence of loue, to doe that which it willeth, vnleſſe it be hindered, Therefore it produceth in vs, not onely a deſire to heare and vnderſtand, the good and euill of the partie beloued: but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs likewiſe by all the meanes wee can, to proſecute the one, and to auoyde the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the which cauſe, loue is ſaid to bee more effectuall then affectuall; <hi>Plus enim facit quam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fficat,</hi> and according to Saint <hi>Gregorie, Probatio amonis
<pb facs="tcp:9319:21"/> eſt exhibitio operis.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Loue without theſe acts and fruits of loue, is worſe then the Fig-tree which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our curſed, and is indeed no loue at all.</p>
               <p>From whence alſo it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that albeit wee may loue thoſe whom we know not in perticuler, as belonging to ſuch an One, or as the parts of ſuch a Communitie which is principally beloued of vs, and may content our ſelues with that generall good which we are able to doe them: yet if our loue be perfit it is impoſſible we ſhould not deſire to know them, and to doe for them alſo in perticuler if we be able, or if our attendance to the perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler knowledge and ſeruice of them, do not hinder ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good, which otherwiſe we
<pb facs="tcp:9319:22"/> might performe in generall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. By which it is manifeſt, that either the Saints in heauen deſire to heare vs, &amp; to releiue vs, not onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but alſo in perticuler when we call vpon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one in them can be no hinderance to the other: Or elſe it muſt needs be granted, that they doe not loue vs. For that without this deſire, it is very plaine they care not for vs.</p>
               <p>I know ſome Proteſtants do here obiect againſt this perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer care, the ſame which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Atheiſts haue alſo obiected againſt the prouidence of God; Affirming that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Caluin. inſtit: lib. 3. cap: 20 per. 24</note> cannot giue eare to our Prayers, or attend to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without ſome trouble and impeachment to their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. But the Proteſtants gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:9319:22"/> as they doe, that this is no trouble at all, neither to the perſon of God, nor to the ſoule of Chriſt, nor to the Angels themſelues (<hi>Pſal. 90. 11. Dan. 10. 13. Zac. 1. 12. Math. 18. 10 Lue. 15. 10. Acts. 12. 15. Apoc.</hi> 8. 3.) make this Obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints of God, with leſſe reaſon and more malice, then it was made by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters before them againſt God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly therfore, this deſire of theirs will yet better appeare by the conſideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Charitie in perticuler.</p>
               <p>For according to that, which hath bene ſaid, as to loue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to will the good, and by conſequence the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is alſo the reaſon that a wicked man, becauſe he willeth not his owne good, as
<pb facs="tcp:9319:23"/> he is wicked, can neuer be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued: ſo to loue God, is nothing elſe, but to will, the will of God; and therefore in effect to deſire that it may be perfitly fulfilled, both in our ſelues, &amp; in all other Creatures.</p>

Therefore to loue God about all thinges, wherin conſiſteth the nature of all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, includeth a will to attend aboue all other thinges vnto the ſanctification &amp; ſaluation, firſt of our ſelues, and ſecondly of all our Brethren. Now then to goe forward, as nothing is deſired, but that which is good: ſo the greater the good is, if it be well knowne and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the more it is deſired; And
<pb facs="tcp:9319:23"/> therfore, as there is nothing ſo good as the will of God: ſo nothing by many degrees can bee ſo much deſired, of thoſe that truely loue God, as that his will be moſt perfitly fulfilled, in the ſanctification and ſaluation of all men.</p>
               <p>Againe, as the will of God himſelf is the end of all things: ſo the loue of his will, and the deſire of dooing thereof, is the end of all other loues, and all other deſires. And therefore, as God himſelfe hath ordained, ſo it muſt needs bee, that our loue of his will, and deſire to fulfill the ſame, if our loue be right, doe exceede with like proportion all other worldly loues or deſires whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to conclude this point; if true loue in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, not onely of grace,
<pb facs="tcp:9319:24"/> but alſo of Nature, produceth in vs a perpetuall and conſtant deſire, not onely to heare and vnderſtand, the good and euill of the parties beloued: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to endeauour by all good meanes and courſes to releeue them; how great muſt the floud and Torrent bee of that deſire, which floweth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the higheſt degree, from the Fountaine and ſowrſe of all loue, which is God himſelfe, into the Soules of the Saints of heauen, to complie, and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with his eternall will, by all the meanes they can, in the ſanctification and ſaluation of others.</p>
               <p>And if the zeale of men on earth, not onely in the time of grace: but alſo vnder the dead letter of the Law, extend it ſelfe with ſuch deſire, not only
<pb facs="tcp:9319:24"/> to heare and vnderſtand, but alſo to ſuccour and redreſſe by their daily prayers, infinit dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers &amp; continuall labours and miſeries of their brethren; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Adde vnto all this, that the felictie of the Saints of heauen, is much increaſed and perfited, by the ſaluation of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

               <p>Thus, as I take it-hauing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed how exceedingly the Saints deſire both to heare and helpe vs in our neceſſities, according to that ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their loue and charitie towards vs, which paſſeth all humane vnderſtanding; let vs now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider whether it follow hereof, that they are able to doe thoſe good Offices for vs, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſo much deſire.

               <p>Whenſoeuer Almighty God giueth a <hi>Loue,</hi> an <hi>Inclination,</hi> or <hi>Deſire</hi> to any thing, hee giueth

<pb facs="tcp:9319:27"/> bringing all thinges to paſſe by Ordinary meanes, hee may conferre the one, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the other?</p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth how vaine it is, which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe here obiect, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Saints haue no eares they cannot heare vs. For albeit they haue no corporall Organ of hearing; yet Almighty God is not ſo poore of power, but that hee may eaſily prouide them of other meanes, For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels, nor the Deuils haue eares; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Proteſtants will not deny; that they haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to heare our wordes when we ſpeake; or which in them is all one, to vnderſtand our meaning. Neither doth the want of an eare, make this kind of hearing the worſe, but rather
<pb facs="tcp:9319:28"/> much the better. For beeing thereby freed from all thoſe conditions and circumſtances, which limit and contract the corporall paſſion and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sence of hearing, to place and diſtance, &amp;c: no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be giuen, but that they may heare as well a farre off, as nere at hand; yea, our thoghts aſwell as our wordes, when we are willing to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> known vnto them.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly therefore (to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) The willingneſſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the Saints in Heauen to heare and aſſiſt vs, is proued out of thoſe Scriptures, which teach vs, that the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the Saints on earth, are all Brethren of the ſame <hi>family,</hi> and <hi>Domeſticals of God; hauing all receiued the adoption</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ: 19. Gal: 4 Ephe, 4 Gal. 4. Heb. 1 23.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Sonnes of God, and beeing all fellow members of the ſame Body, and Cittizens of the ſame Citty, which is the heauenly Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem our Mother, the Church of the firſt borne, including the
<pb facs="tcp:9319:31"/> ſocietie of many thouſand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being ſuppoſed, wee may argue in this manner. In euery Myſticall body or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the principall and more perfite members, haue power and abilitie more or leſſe to helpe and aſſiſt the reſt that are more imperfit, according to their particuler neceſſities. For this is the end of all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and therefore ſo true, that no citty or kingdome, or ciuill Body can ſtand without it. But the Saints in Heauen, are the principall partes of this Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body; Therefore it muſt needes follow, that they haue ſome kinde of meanes to heare and to helpe vs in perticuler, when wee call vpon them. For otherwiſe, they could neither make one Family, nor one citty
<pb facs="tcp:9319:31"/> nor one Body with vs, which is directly againſt the Scriptures here before alleadged.</p>
               <p>Againe, in euery Societie, thoſe members that are out of daunger and in proſperitie, are bound in duty to ſuccour thoſe that are in any great danger or neceſſitie, eſpecially when it greatly concerneth the good of the whole Body. But ſuch are the Saints of heauen, and ſuch is the caſe between vs and them, eſpecially when we finde our ſelues aſſaulted with ſome grieuous affliction, or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Temptation in perticuler; Therefore according to their power, when ſuch occaſions happen, they are bound as may be ſaid in duty to releeue vs. <hi>Hee</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Iohn) that ſhall haue the Subſtance of this world, and ſhall ſee his Brother haue
<pb facs="tcp:9319:32"/> neede, and ſhall ſhut his Bowels from him; how doth the Charitie of God abide in him?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Saints of God, <hi>hauing the ſubſtance</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other world: and poſſeſſing the Treaſures of all Graces, wee muſt either fowly condemne them, for want of <hi>Charity;</hi> or elſe, wee muſt needs graunt, that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>their Bowels</hi> to releeue the neceſſities of their diſtreſſed brethren. And truely Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, ſeeing the want of this power in his Saints to help vs (if it were ſo as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants would haue it) and the Saints againe ſeeing our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or if they doe not, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not; how may it be thought, that either God himſelfe can ſhut the Bowels of his Charitie from them, when they aske the one: or
<pb facs="tcp:9319:32"/> they from vs, when we call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be releeued in the other? Wherfore to conclude this ſecond reaſon, for the proofe of their Power to helpe vs; conſider gentle Reader, whether it can ſtand, either with the vnitie of this myſticall body, that the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſhould not haue it: or with their Obligation not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it: or with their felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie not to inioy it: or with Gods goodneſſe not to graunt it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly then, this willingnes and power of theirs is yet further proued, by their ſpeciall Patronage and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of vs; for the one doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently include the other, and no man can imagine, how they can be truely ſaid to guide and defend vs, who like the Idols
<pb facs="tcp:9319:33"/> of the Gentiles, are neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heare vs nor to helpe vs. Wherefore, their Paſtorall care and protection ouer vs is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, firſt, by reaſon grounded vpon Scripture, and ſecondly, by the Scripture it ſelfe. And the firſt reaſon thereof, may be framed in this manner. In eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ordered Body or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, the members which are the moſt potent pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and perfit, are appointed to gouerne and protect the reſt.

<pb facs="tcp:9319:34"/> that are apt to be made the inſtruments of his Diuine power. Not that hee hath any neede of them, but becauſe it belongeth to his glory &amp; their perfection, as much as may be, to be ſerued of them. Which is not onely ſeene in the viſible preſeruation of this world, all thinges depending therein of more inferiour cauſes: but alſo confeſſed in the inuiſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and Gouernours thereof, his holy Angels. Who are therefore, in generall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Spirits,</hi> and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14</note> teſtified among other<note place="margin">Num. 20 16.</note> thinges, to haue had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> out of<note place="margin">Exod. 23 20.</note> Aegypt, and in the perſon of God, to haue giuen the Law it<note place="margin">Act. 7. 30 35. 53.</note> ſelfe vnto them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Saints of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="tcp:9319:34"/> being ſo much more fit to gouerne and protect vs, then the Angels: by how much they are nearer vnto vs both by Grace and Nature, and through their owne experience of our fragilitie, haue better learned to take compaſſion of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie: It cannot ſtand with the ſweetneſſe of Gods proul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to exclude them from the Patronage and protection of vs. For the which hee hath made them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

CHampion of God, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commer of Deuils, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Hell, the honour and wonder of the deſart, I addreſſe particularly to thee my ſighes: and to thee I lift vp the voyce of my deſires; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much thou haſt done
<pb facs="tcp:9319:117"/> for God, and how much thou art able to doe with God. Bee thou then pleaſed to obtaine for mee, three graces of him, who beſtowed them vpon thee with many moe? the one is the guift of Prayer, and an inward conuerſation with God; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perfect victorie of my temptations; and the third an inflamed Loue of him, which is the lone of Heauen and earth, IESVS the Son of God. Thou haſt ſo excelled in the firſt, that during the time thou wert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in prayer, yeares were to thee but monthes; monthes but weekes; weeks but dayes; dayes but howers; and howers but minutes. The Sunne going downe left thee praying: and riſing againe hee found thee praying, and whilſt he caſt forth his beames ſomtimes vpon thy
<pb facs="tcp:9319:117"/> backe, and ſometimes vpon thy face, the holy Ghoſt was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king interiourly and effected wonderfull thinges in the moſt fruitfull ſoyle of thy ſoule. As for temptations, Hell trembled at thee, and the Deuill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as vanquiſhed and taken captiue in thy preſence. For thou wentſt not out of the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, as we doe, who ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are either beaten or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
